                <p>May 19th was a very important day for me. It was the day I met my favorite band, Of  Mice & Men.</p>
                <p>I remember getting to the venue around 2 p.m. I decided to arrive early because the meet and greet was at 5 p.m and I wanted to be in the front of the line. I was a bit nervous to wait in line because I was alone, but I ended up making two friends to make my time waiting more cozy. Time went by fast and before I knew it the line began to move. They escorted us up the stairs of the venue and we had to form another line beside the stage. We were all trying our hardest to remain calm, but we were too excited. We were about to meet our favorite band.</p>
                <p>As the line got shorter, I got closer. I was so happy because I was getting closer and closer to finally being able to talk to my favorite band, and maybe even get a hug. Before I knew it, I was two steps away from the lead vocalist, Austin Carlile. I couldn't believe it because I waited two years to meet him and it was finally going to happen. I was finally going to be able to thank him and the band for all they’ve done, their music has impacted so many people. It has helped many people and that’s amazing. Whenever we feel sad all we have to do is put in our headphones and we won’t feel alone anymore.</p>
                <p>When I walked up to him I immediately went for a hug, I felt like I was meeting a close friend of mine for the first time. Seeing him made me really happy, the happiest I had been in a while. He had the biggest smile on his face, you could see the happiness in his eyes. You could tell that he really did enjoy meeting his fans. We had a small conversation and then I went to meet the other members. I gave them all hugs and had small conversations with them.</p>
                <p>After talking to them, we were put into another line for pictures and then waited in line for the show. The show started around 7 p.m, but we were let into the venue early. I fought my way to the barrier, and I was happy with the spot I got. I was in middle and got the perfect view of the stage. Finally, Of Mice & Men played around 8:30 p.m.</p>
                <p>Towards the last few songs of the night I began to get sad. I was replaying everything in my mind. I replayed how I felt when I saw the guys, when I hugged them, what they said to me, and how I felt in the crowd. I couldn't believe that it all happened. The day felt too good to be true, it felt like it was all just a dream, but it wasn't. It actually happened and I was so happy that it did, because it showed me that dreams really can come true. I never would have imagined that I would actually meet my favorite band, I never thought I would actually meet Austin Carlile. That man means so much to me. He has taught me so many things and he has motivated me to never give up when things get difficult.</p>
                <p>My night was so great that I didn’t want to go home. I didn’t want them to leave, I wanted them to stay on stage and play all night because everyone was having such a good time. None of us wanted them to leave, especially me. I felt safe in the venue. Why? Because I was surrounded by people just like me, people who found comfort and safety in being surrounded by music.</p>

                <h1>Chipotle vs E.Coli Essay</h1>

                <p>If my favorite restaurant gained a reputation for dangerous E. coli outbreaks, I would lose trust for that place and stop eating there. If restaurants choose to serve meat to their customers, it is important to be sure that the meat is checked and safe for customers to consume. Restaurants should be able to proudly say that their meat is safe for consumption. Customers should not have to worry about whether or not they will get sick after digesting a dish from their menu.</p>
                <p>When I go out to eat, I hope to have a nice experience. I do not want to have to feel afraid that the food will make me sick or endanger my health. I do not want to visit the hospital because of something I ate. I go to my favorite restaurant for fun; vomiting is not fun. E. coli can lead to even worse effects than vomiting, and is in some cases fatal.</p>
                <p>It is important for a restaurant to make sure they pass their food inspections so customers can trust them. Restaurants should be able to be completely be honest with their customers about the food they are serving. Although, there are some restaurants that are either not honest with their customers because they are afraid of ruining business, or are just not aware of what is going on with the meat or food they are serving. Just in case, it is a good thing for customers to check out a restaurant before deciding to eat there.</p>
                <p>Customers want to be sure the place they are eating at is clean. There are a few fast food restaurants that have had E. coli outbreaks in the past such as McDonald’s, KFC, Taco Bell, and Jack in the Box (warpedspeed.com). The most recent E. coli outbreak happened in Chipotle. Chipotle’s website has a page dedicated to this incident on which they attempt to assure customers that their restaurants are clean. It says that they are, “Conducting additional deep cleaning and sanitization.” This might make customers feel better, but if E. coli outbreaks continue to occur, will customers continue to believe the kitchens are clean?</p>
                <p>I would not want to eat at my favorite restaurant if I had to worry about whether or not their food contained E. coli. We should be able to trust the restaurants we eat at. No one wants to worry about getting sick. Restaurants should be capable of keeping their food and environment clean.</p>

                <h1>The First Thanksgiving</h1>

                <p>In 1614 a band of English explorers sailed home to England with a ship full of Patuxet Indians bound for slavery. They left behind smallpox which wiped out those who were able to escape. By the time Pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts Bay, they found one Patuxet Indian, Squanto,  who escaped slavery and knew their language. He taught them how to grow and fish, and also negotiated a peace treaty between the Pilgrims and Wampanoag Nation. They had a feast honoring Wampanoag and Squanto.</p>
                <p>As word spread in England about paradise found in a new world, Puritans began to arrive. They found no fences and considered it to be public domain. British settlers joined and began to seize the land capturing strong young Natives and killing the rest. The Pequot Nation did not agree to the peace treaty Squanto negotiated, they fought back.  The Pequot war was one of the bloodiest.</p>
                <p>In 1637 the Pequot Tribe gathered their Green Corn Festival, which is our Thanksgiving celebration. In predawn hours Indians were surrounded by English and Dutch mercenaries who order them to come out. Who ever did was shot or clubbed to death. Women and children who huddled in the longhouse were burned alive.</p>
                <p>The governor of Massachusetts bay called it “A Day Of Thanksgiving” because 700 unarmed people were murdered. Brave colonists attack village after village. Women and kids were sold into slavery, the rest were murdered.</p>
                <p>Churches announced a second day of “Thanksgiving” to celebrate victory over the heathen savages. During feasts, hacked off heads of Natives were used as soccer balls. The Wampanoag were not able to escape this frenzy. The chief was beheaded and had his head impaled on a pole where it remained for years. Killings became more and more frenzied, feasts were held after every successful massacre</p>

                <p>Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770 in the city of Bonn. He was baptised on December 17, 1770. His family originated from Brabant, in Belgium. Beethoven has seven siblings. Only two of them made it to adulthood, Caspar and Johann. Johann Van Beethoven, his father was a musician and an alcoholic. Maria Magdalena Van Beethoven, his mother was a deeply moralistic women.</p>
                <p>Beethoven’s father began teaching him how to play music with rigor and brutality that affected him for the rest of his life. Some neighbors said that they spotted Beethoven weeping while playing his instrument. His father also abused him whenever he hesitated to play a note or made a mistake.</p>
                <p>On almost a daily basis , he was locked in a cellar and deprived of sleep for extra hours of practice. Beethoven studied the violin and clavier with his father as well as taking additional lessons. Beethoven’s father arranged his first public recital for March 26, 1778. His father hoped that his son's talent would be recognized. He was an average student and possibly had mild dyslexia. At the age of ten, Beethoven withdrew from school to study music full time. At the age of twelve, Beethoven published his first composition. It was a set of piano variations on a theme by an obscure classical composer named Dressler. Beethoven studied Mozart, along with Bach and other famous composers. He composed several of his own works and later on published them.</p>
                <p>Most of his life his hearing was fine, but there were some reports of Beethoven saying that he heard “ringing”. In about 1800, Beethoven slowly began to lose his hearing. By the last decade of his life he fully lost his hearing.</p>
                <p>Beethoven is mostly known for his nine symphonies, which have been called the cornerstones of Western civilization. The most famous are the Fifth Symphony and the Ninth Symphony.  The bars in the Fifth Symphony are supposed to represent fate knocking at the door.</p>
